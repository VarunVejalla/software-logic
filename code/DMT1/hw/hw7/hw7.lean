(1) Read the class notes on Predicate Logic through (and including) 8.4, extended from 8.3 as announced. You're prepared to read 8.4 but a good bit of it will be new material, so plan to dedicate a good number of hours to reading this material. I will go over it in class, of course, but you will greatly benefit by reading it first, then hearing it explained, and finally practicing with the ideas.

(2) For additional preparation, please read Functional Programming in Lean (link under Resources), Section 1.6 through 1.8 inclusive and Section 3 (pretty short) in its entirety.

(3) For further additional preparation, please re-read Section 2, and read Section 3, in Theorem Proving in Lean 4.
