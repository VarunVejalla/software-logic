# Structural Recursion

This topic was not covered systematically in classes taught to date. With time saved up
front by skipping SMT, in part or whole, it could perhaps be incorporated. Termination by descent through well ordered relations in general, with recursion on subterms of given terms always terminating, with all terms by definition finitely constructed. The more difficult case in general is generative recursion. This really should be a capstone concept in full formality and generality. It would be better to skip or make optional the SMT experience to make time to cover these ideas. Well orderedness is already covered in the litany of properties of relations that we did present, and that I expected the students to be able to read, understand, and work with in Lean.
